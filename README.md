# Food Truck Project

## Description

This project was supposed to take in up to five user-provided food trucks.  Each truck would be supplied with a name, a food type, and a one-to-five star rating.

After providing one or more food truck reviews, the user would access a menu to list all food trucks, see an average of the ratings, see the highest-rated food truck, or quit the program.

I was unable to complete this project because of continuous errors saying that I could not reference a non-static method or object with a static method or object, or vice-versa.

## Lessons Learned

I quickly learned in this project that though I feel confident in learning the broad skills presented in the course, I am not prepared to handle the problem-solving and trouble-shooting techniques that are needed to resolve critical problems in code.

It's documented in social science that as humans age, they require more hands-on kinesthetic learning (with demonstrations and through practical application) to gain enough familiarity with a skill to practice it on their own.

I fear that my age, coupled with my service-connected disabilities, will make it extremely difficult to complete this course effectively.  I am at a point that I'm not sure I will succeed.

Up to this point, most of the materials were a review.  This was the first time that I finally understood how object-oriented programming works, despite having attempted to learn it for years now.  Even though I learned a lot in the past week, this homework revealed that I am not nearly capable enough to perform even the most basic tasks in OOP. I am reaching new frontiers in my understanding of programming, and I am not confident that my health or skill will allow me to keep up with the pace at which we push this frontier.
